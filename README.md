# Overview

This repository contains the junit tests to demonstrate how XStream v1.4.11 respond to the security issues http://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2013-7285.html and http://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2017-7957.html.

# Summary on behaviour through v1.4.7 to v1.4.11.1

A way to deal with CVE_2013_7285 is provided through v1.4.7. But issue again is showed up while fixing CVE-2017-7957 in v1.4.10.

So v1.4.11 is released to fix the broken issue. 

However, it broke the java runtime environments below JDK 8.0. So, v1.4.11.1 is released to address that.
